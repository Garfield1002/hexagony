# Hexagony

Simple single file haskell command-line interpreter for the [Hexagony](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Hexagony) programming language.

## ‚öô Usage

`$./hexagony prg.hxg`

## ‚ö° Performance

Running this interpreter on very large hexagony programs (such as [MeWhenI's Brainfuck Interpreter](https://github.com/MeWhenI/Brainfuck-In-Hexagony)), it seems that this interpreter is significantly quicker (about 2x) than [SirBogman's fast C# interpreter](https://github.com/SirBogman/Hexagony).

I am missing a better / more consistent way of measuring and comparing interpreter performance.

## üèÅ Roadmap

[ ] Add support for debug symbol

[ ] Better error messages

[ ] More command line options
